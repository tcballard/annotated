# Acceptance evidence

Last run: 2026-08-01

This record supplements [`BRIEF_ACCEPTANCE.md`](./BRIEF_ACCEPTANCE.md). It is
evidence from the current stacked branch, not a claim that the external
production gates are complete.

## Clean-checkout validation

The following checks passed on `agent/brief-11-feed-search`:

```text
npm ci
npm run build
npm test                         # 27 passing tests
node --check server/*.js src/*.js extension/*.js test/*.js scripts/*.js
git diff --check
```

The local API and Vite app were run together at `http://localhost:8787` and
`http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## Browser acceptance run

The local browser run exercised the user-facing flows below:

- Capture desk loaded with the local API, Article mode selected, and a
  highlighted passage visible for a `theverge.com` source.
- A text annotation was published. The public page showed a stable `/a/:slug`
  link, the canonical source link, the success state, and `File a claim`.
- The claim dialog accepted a reason and returned `Claim received. We’ll
  review the source.`.
- A comment was posted from the public page and appeared in the conversation
  with the author identity and an updated comment count.
- Discover loaded the server-backed public feed. `For you` rendered feed
  entries with source links, author controls, follow controls, and like/comment
  counts.
- Video mode showed the YouTube source fixture, start/end controls, `1:30 max`,
  and the `video downscaled to 240p` boundary copy.
- Podcast mode showed the podcast source fixture, the same 90-second boundary,
  and its source link.
- Audio commentary mode showed `Start recording`, `Record a 90-second take`,
  and the empty `0:00` state. Microphone permission and an actual recording
  were not requested in this run.
- The source-change control accepted a loopback URL; the API rejected it with
  `That source host is not allowed`. The form stayed open and rendered an ARIA
  `alert` with the resolver error while keeping the existing preview visible.
  The valid source was restored afterward.
- Discover search opened a labeled search form, returned matching server-backed
  annotations for `Rights smoke`, and showed a recoverable empty state for
  `unmatched phrase` with a clear-search action.
- Media-policy tests cover cancellation checks before both a late successful
  publish and a retry update, preventing a cancelled job from being revived by
  a child-process completion.

## Deliberately unverified external gates

These remain `partial` or unchecked in the matrix until real configuration and
evidence are available:

- Google/X OAuth callback, cancellation, logout, and expiry against real
  provider credentials.
- PostgreSQL and S3/R2/CDN deployment with migrations, cleanup, backups, and
  recovery against production-like services.
- Real YouTube/news/podcast extraction and FFmpeg output inspection, including
  a generated file proven to be no longer than 90 seconds and video proven to
  be 240p.
- Installed Chrome side-panel acceptance, extension audio capture, offline
  queue recovery, and service-worker/sidebar lifecycle checks.
- Multi-user production feed, follow, comment, claims, and moderation evidence.
- Production observability, deployment, security, and readiness checks.
